### [Labor Market Analysis](LaborMarket)

### [Finance Manager](FinanceManager)

Collection class that fetches investment data from TD Ameritrade and Coinbase APIs and then merges this data together into a dataframe. A main script is then used for running the program from the terminal. 

Why? I don't want to have to sign into several platforms to calculate investments - that's annoying

To Do: 

[] - Basic portfolio analytics

### [Bayesian Networks](BayesianNetworks)

### [Bayesian Neural Network](Bayesian_NeuralNet.ipynb)

Using PyMC3 to implement a neural network for classification on a basic data set

Why? Experimentation with PyMC3 and to learn more about neural networks. Also, as usual with Bayesian methods, we have access to uncertainty and probabilities into what the model has predicted.   

### [Inference vs Prediction](Inference_vs_Prediction)

A recreation of Will Kurt's [Count Bayesie](https://www.countbayesie.com/) blog post on a different data set (I also thought it would be a good opportunity to learn some of the basics behind JAX). 

Why? As the field of Data Science and ML develops, I feel their is an over emphasis and far too common mistake of treating problems as pure "prediction" problems. Instead, modeling should be seen as a hollistic process that extends our mathematical reasoning to its fullest. 

Inference allows us to be more concerned with the properties of our model itself rather than just its predictions. The inputs, weights, and biases can offer a remedy to understand how the world works. . .in a simplified manner. _What did the model actually learn; rather than simply interpreting the output?_ _Is their uncertainty in the model's parameters?_
