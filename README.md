### [Inference vs Prediction](Inference_vs_Prediction)

A recreation of Will Kurt's [Count Bayesie](https://www.countbayesie.com/) blog post on a different data set (I also thought it would be a good opportunity to learn some of the basics behind JAX). 

Why? As the field of Data Science and ML develops, I feel their is an over emphasis and far too common mistake of treating problems as pure "prediction" problems. Instead, modeling should be seen as a hollistic process that extends our mathematical reasoning to its fullest. 

Inference allows us to be more concerned with the properties of our model itself rather than just its predictions. The inputs, weights, and biases can offer a remedy to understand how the world works. . .in a simplified manner. _What did the model actually learn; rather than simply interpreting the output?_ _Is their uncertainty in the model's parameters?_
